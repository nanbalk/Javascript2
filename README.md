When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:
The HTML DOM Tree of Objects
DOM HTML tree

The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

    The HTML elements as objects
    The properties of all HTML elements
    The methods to access all HTML elements
    The events for all HTML elements

In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
